## Brief:   
The aim of the project was to design and create a web application for mobile or
stationary device, which in its assumption was able to compete on a dynamic mobile
application market. The current mobile application market is saturated with applications
of various aims, functions and usages. For that reason and following thorough
research of the most popular apps in the store, a decision was made to create an
application which addresses the issue faced by millions of gamers around the world -
loneliness in the virtual world of games.
